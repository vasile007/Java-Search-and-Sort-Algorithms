# 🔍📊 Java Search and Sort Algorithms

Welcome to my Java algorithms project! This repository includes clean and easy-to-understand implementations of classic **searching** and
**sorting algorithms** using **Java **. Whether you're learning data structures or preparing for coding interviews, this project is a helpful resource.

## 🚀 Algorithms Implemented

### 🔎 Searching Algorithms
- **Linear Search** – Searches each element one by one.
- **Binary Search** – Efficient search in sorted arrays using divide-and-conquer.

### 🔃 Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort** – Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort** – Selects the smallest/largest element and moves it to the sorted part.
- **Insertion Sort** – Builds a sorted list by inserting elements one at a time.
- **Merge Sort** – Recursively divides and merges sorted subarrays.
- **Quick Sort** – Uses a pivot to partition and recursively sort subarrays.
