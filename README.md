# 🔍📊 Java Search and Sort Algorithms

Welcome to my Java algorithms project! This repository contains clean and easy-to-understand implementations of classic **searching** and **sorting** algorithms using **Java**. Whether you're learning data structures or preparing for coding interviews, this project serves as a great reference and practice tool.

---

## 🚀 Algorithms Implemented

### 🔎 Searching Algorithms

- **Linear Search** – Iterates through each element one by one.
- **Binary Search** – Efficiently searches sorted arrays using a divide-and-conquer approach.

### 🔃 Sorting Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort** – Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort** – Selects the smallest or largest element and places it in its correct position.
- **Insertion Sort** – Builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- **Merge Sort** – Recursively divides the array and merges sorted subarrays.
- **Quick Sort** – Partitions the array around a pivot and recursively sorts the subarrays.

## 💻 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-algorithms.git
   cd java-algorithms
'''
Compile and run (example for LinearSearch):

javac LinearSearch.java
java LinearSearch
Repeat for any algorithm class you'd like to run (e.g., BubbleSort, QuickSort, etc.).

🧰 Technologies Used
Java 17+

Command-line tools or any IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

🧠 Purpose
Reinforce understanding of common algorithmic techniques

Serve as study material for technical interviews

Provide readable and reusable Java code for basic algorithmic problems
